The platform aims at facilitating the implementation of parallel surrogate-based optimization algorithms. pySBO provides re-usable algorithmic components (surrogate models, evolution controls, infill criteria, evolutionary operators) as well as the foundations to ensure the components inter-changeability. Actual implementations of sequential and parallel surrogate-based optimization algorithms are supplied as ready-to-use tools to handle expensive single- and multi-objective problems. The illustrated documentation of pySBO is available on-line through a dedicated web-site.
