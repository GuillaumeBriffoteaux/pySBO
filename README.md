The platform aims at facilitating the implementation of parallel surrogate-based optimization algorithms. pySBO provides re-usable algorithmic components (surrogate models, evolution controls, infill criteria, evolutionary operators) as well as the foundations to ensure the components inter-changeability. Actual implementations of sequential and parallel surrogate-based optimization algorithms are supplied as ready-to-use tools to handle very and moderately expensive mono- and multi-objective problems with continuous decision variables. The MPI implementation of parallel algorithms allows to execute on distributed machines. Box-constraints are explicitly integrated while more elaborated constraints must be handled by the user. The illustrated documentation of pySBO is available on-line through a dedicated web-site.

pySBO is organized following the one-class-per-file Java convention. Consequently, each module is nammed after the class it contains.
